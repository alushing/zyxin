This repository contains scripts used to quantify LIM protein patches lifetimes, VASP and ɑ-actinin binding to zyxin, actin polymerization at zyxin patches, bundle thickening, and droplet protein enrichment in in vitro reconstitution assays.

classify-patches.py computes the various patch structures observed and their lifetime.

actin_area_measure.py computes the initial actin area in each TIRF movie.

vasp_patch_quant_average_window_2.py computes the enrichment of VASP on zyxin patches and its lifetimes.

ACTN1_lifetimequant_for_movies.py computes the enrichemnt of ɑ-actinin on zyxin patches and clusters.

ACTN1_intensity_quant_for_noATP_images.py computes the enrichment of ɑ-actinin & zyxin on ɑ-actinin-zyxin clusters

droplet_quant_v3.py computes the enrichment of zyxin within droplets.

profilactin_integrated_density_quant.py computes the fold increase in actin around zyxin patches over time

bundle_thickness_indenx_quant.py computes bundle thickness over time.
